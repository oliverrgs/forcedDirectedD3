This is a simple app to demonstrate D3 force directed graphs and auth0.

to run:
npm install && npm start

to login
john@a.com / aaaaaa1*
jane@a.com / aaaaaa1*

jane uses emails.json as her json, so copy that file into public as it is 1.7gb and won't be committed. For this reason Jane's chart also will not work.
